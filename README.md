This is a code resource that is being created for more dynamical object-based management of atmospheric observations in 4 dimensions using profile theory, that all these obs come from single dimensional profiles, with medatadata.

The code is meant to read in (though this is not meant to be the power) format, archive, and quickly access this kind of data for 4 dimensions.
