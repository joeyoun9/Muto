Decoders is a package which will provide resources for converting 
as-generic-as-possible data messages from instruments and data sources
into at least somewhat nicely formatted numpy arrays. 

None of these codes will be particularly useful on their own. but they 
can be easily combined with other scripts. Dependencies will be limited
to the muto codebase as well, and almost all methods should be able to be 
imported and run independently for whatever operation is needed.

Outputs will be specific to the development stage at this time. In the future 
they may be reworked to return specific muto data objects.
